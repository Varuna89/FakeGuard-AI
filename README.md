# FakeGuard-AI
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately identify and categorize news articles as either fake or genuine. Given the potentially harmful impacts of fake news on individuals and society, this model aims to help mitigate these effects by providing reliable classification. To achieve this, the project employs a variety of classification techniques, each providing a unique approach to solving the problem.
